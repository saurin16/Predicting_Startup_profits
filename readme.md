# Startup Profits Prediction System and Flask API Deployment

## Overview

This system predicts profits for startup companies based on various factors such as R&D spending, administration expenses, marketing expenses, and the state in which the startup is located. Additionally, it includes a Flask API deployment, allowing users to interact with the prediction model via API requests.
